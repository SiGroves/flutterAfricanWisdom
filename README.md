# flutterAfricanWisdom
A Flutter project using locally stored data to present a random set of inspirational words.


.dart files should be in folder named lib

pubspec.yaml file should be in root

.png should be in folder called images

Orignal folder was called flutter_app_african_wisdom so you may need to make changes to main.dart to reference the supporting files.
